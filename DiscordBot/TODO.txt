TODOS: 
- Generate a label -- we focus primarily on crypto/pig butchering
    - Eg: Ask user if this is a crypto-/pig-butchering related issue
    - If yes: in scope -- continue investigation; otherwise not in scope point to other resources
- Begin setting up consequences -- eg, reports > # = mute, kick, ban, etc

Completed: 
- Set up basic json file to track # of user reports
